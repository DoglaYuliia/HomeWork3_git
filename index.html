        Hello! My name is Julia, I'm 33 and I'm currently a student at Hillel School on the Front End Basic course. I
        was born and lived all my life in the city of Dnipro, but because of the war I temporarily live and work in
        Sweden. For the last 5 years I worked as a buyer in a large furniture corporation, it was an interesting and
        exciting job. But one day I started watching Python exercises online and finally decided to plunge into this
        wonderful world of IT.
